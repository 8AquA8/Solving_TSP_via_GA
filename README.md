# Solving_TSP_via_GA
This repository provides a Genetic Algorithm (GA) solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), featuring my proposed "Flipped PMX Crossover GA." This algorithm is shown to have improvement over the traditional PMX crossover in VLSI data when the sites get larger.

The key difference of Flipped PMX Crossover GA compared to the traditional PMX crossover GA is that it strategically flips segments of the parents' genetic material during the crossover step. This flipping mechanism preserves valuable genetic information and enhances the exploration of the solution space, leading to better optimization results.
